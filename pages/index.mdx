# Kobra Onboarding

Hey! Welcome to Kobra! We're so happy that you're trying it out, and we'd love your feedback! Here are some basic instructions for how to get started with Kobra – we really hope you won't have to use these instructions, but when you do, please take a note of it so we'll know which parts of the experience aren't intuitive

---

Here are the basic steps to creating a Kobra program (we're going to be creating a Simple Linear Regression):

1. Upload dataset

    Download dataset [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kobra-dev/datasets/main/Salary_Data.csv)

    - Upload the file

        In the top right, go to the file upload tab and upload your dataset. If this isn't intuitive, please make a note of it

    - Load in the dataset

        Go to the variables tab and create a variable for data

        Set the data variable to a new dataframe – make the filename the same as the dataset you uploaded (the String block is in the text tab)

2. Create X and y variables
    - Create variables for X and y

        Go to the variables tab and create a variable for X and y

    - Set each variable to one column of the dataframe

        Drag out the "Get column" block from the dataframes tab

3. Create scatterplot
    - Add a scatterplot to the plo

        Get this blocks from the plots tab, and add it to your program

4. Click the run button to view your scatterplot (in data visualization tab)
5. Create & Train Linear Regression Model
    - Create a variable for your linear regression model

        Go to the variables tab, and create a variable for a model

    - Set it to a linear regression model

        Drag out the linear regression model from the Linear Regression tab and set model to it

    - Fit the linear regression model

        Drag out the `fit linear regression model` block and fit the model variable

6. Make prediction with linear regression
    - Make a prediction and print it out

        Drag out the print block from the text category, and then use the create text block to combine a string saying "Prediction (5 yrs experience)" and your predction

        Add in a prediction block, where you're making a prediction with your linear regression model (in linear regression tab)
