# Project page

Each Kobra project has a corresponding project page. Through this page you can view information about the project, and if it is yours, you can edit it. If the project is private, only the owner of the project can view the project page.

<Callout emoji="❗">
    Right now, project pages are somewhat slow to load. We're working on finding the cause, and will update this page when they are fixed.
