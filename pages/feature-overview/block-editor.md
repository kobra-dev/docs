# Block editor

At the heart of Kobra is its block editor (built on [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)). The block editor is used to build programs without needing to know about complicated programming language syntax. 

On the left side, there is a toolbox, which holds all of the available blocks:

If you click on a tab, a flyout will open with the contents of it. You can then drag a block from the flyout onto the workspace.

To build a program, connect blocks to the "on run" block. Blocks will snap together when you drag them close to each other.

To get rid of a block, you can drag it onto the trash can, drag it onto the toolbox, or right click on it and select "delete block." To restore a deleted block, click on the trash can. A panel will open with its contents.
