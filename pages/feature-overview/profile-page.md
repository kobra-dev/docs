# Profile page

Your profile page shows some information about you (a bio and URL that you can customize) and all of your public projects. Right now, it doesn't do much, but as we implement more features we'll make it more useful.

You can access a users profile page at https://studio.kobra.dev/user/ [insert username here], or by clicking on the user chip on a project page:
