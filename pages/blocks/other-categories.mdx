Any other blocks are part of Blockly's default blocks. You can find documentation for them [here](https://github.com/google/blockly/wiki). Note that we use the plus/minus plugin, so instead of regular "mutators" (the gear thing you might see in some screenshots) you will need to use the plus and minus icons on blocks.
